Absolutely! Let's take a high-level tour of the basics:

### NumPy:
1. **What is NumPy?**  
   A Python library for numerical operations. It's the backbone of most mathematical and scientific computations in Python.

2. **Arrays**:  
   The core of NumPy. Think of them like lists in Python, but faster and more compact. Can be multi-dimensional (1D, 2D, 3D, etc.).

3. **Basic Operations**:  
   Just like with numbers, you can do arithmetic with arrays: add, subtract, multiply, divide, etc. Operations are element-wise.

4. **Broadcasting**:  
   A fancy term for how NumPy handles element-wise binary operations with arrays of different shapes.

5. **Indexing and Slicing**:  
   Like accessing a particular element in a list (`list[2]`) but can be done in multiple dimensions (`array[2,3]`).

6. **Aggregation**:  
   Combining multiple values into one. Think of `sum()`, `mean()`, `max()`, and `min()`.

### Statistics:

1. **What is Statistics?**  
   The study of data: how to collect, analyze and interpret it.

2. **Mean**:  
   Average of a dataset. Add up all numbers, then divide by the number of numbers.

3. **Median**:  
   The middle number in a sorted dataset. If there's two middle numbers, it's the average of those two.

4. **Mode**:  
   The number that appears most frequently in a dataset.

5. **Variance & Standard Deviation**:  
   Measure of how spread out numbers are. If the numbers are all close to the mean, these values are low. If they're spread out, they're high.

6. **Probability**:  
   Chance of something happening. Like rolling a 6 on a dice â€“ the probability is 1/6.

7. **Distributions**:  
   How data is spread out. The bell curve (or normal distribution) is a famous example.

8. **Correlation**:  
   How two sets of data move in relation to each other.

### Learning Curve Tip:

**Consistent Practice**: Imagine learning to ride a bike. No matter how many books or videos you consume about it, you only truly learn when you actually do it. Similarly, with NumPy and statistics (or any domain, really), it's all about consistent practice. Spend some time each day coding and working with data, even if it's just for a short period. Over time, you'll become more proficient and comfortable with the concepts and techniques. Remember, it's a marathon, not a sprint!
