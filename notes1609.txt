# Variance and Std Deviation

# As a quick exercise, consider two scenarios:
# You have five friends, and all of them are 30 years old.
# You have five friends with ages 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50.
# In which scenario is the variance higher? Naturally, in the second
# scenario, there's a broader spread of ages, leading to higher variance. 
# In the first scenario, the variance is zero because there's no variability
# in ages â€“ they're all the same.

# Low Variance: All your darts land very close to each other, 
# maybe around the bullseye. They don't stray far from the average 
# landing spot (the mean).
##########################
# High Variance: Your darts are scattered all over the target. 
# They're far from the average landing spot and also far from each other.

# Deviation

# Gives you an idea of how far each individual data point strays 
#from the average.

# Variance

# Variance is like finding the "average squared length" of these
# deviations. By squaring, we ensure two things:
# All deviations are non-negative (so they don't cancel out).
# Larger deviations have a disproportionately larger influence on
# the outcome.
